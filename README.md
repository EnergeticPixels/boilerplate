# <center>Project Boilerplate</center>
### <center>Opinionated project boilerplate</center>

## Mission:
This is a boilerplate for any project.  It does not contain determining frameworks like express or restify or mongoose. It does set up 'programmer helpers' such as eslint, prettier, and babel. Getting started on the right foot in any project will determine its cost/benefit ratio.

## Development Methodology:
* Just the basics.
* Each project started from this boilerplate will need to modify these settings ever so slightly depending on that project's specific needs.

## Accolades
- Alex Modovan. (https://medium.freecodecamp.org/adding-some-air-to-the-airbnb-style-guide-3df40e31c57a) Improvement on AirBnB eslint styleguide.
- Wes Bos.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIvjKId9m2c)  Getting eslint/prettier to work inside VS Code.

### Node Technologies:
- NODE: version 8 or above.  NPM: version 6 or above.
- Eslint: 
- Prettier: Making sure that my code is easily read by other programmers in one style.
  - I am using VSCode.  You do not need to install the prettier VSCode extension since we are doing it through project's eslint.
- Babel: Transpiling advanced javascript code. At this point, taking care of the 'imports' and 'exports default' statement
- NYC: for code coverage. tracking api reliability

###  TODOs
- None assigned yet.

If you're new to Node.js, these steps will get you started. Advanced users may want to look at the start-node.bat script and configure it for their environment. *nix shell scripts are also included, run `chmod 755 *.sh` if needed.
